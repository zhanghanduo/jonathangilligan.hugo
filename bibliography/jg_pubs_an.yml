  note: 'Manuscript: 287 pp.'
  abstract: Private sector action provides one of the most promising opportunities
    to reduce the risks of climate change, buying time while governments move slowly
    or even oppose climate mitigation. Starting with the insight that much of the
    resistance to climate mitigation is grounded in concern about the role of government,
    this books draws on law, policy, social science, and climate science to demonstrate
    how private initiatives are already bypassing government inaction in the US and
    around the globe. It makes a persuasive case that private governance can reduce
    global carbon emissions by a billion tons per year over the next decade. Combining
    an examination of the growth of private climate initiatives over the last decade,
    a theory of why private actors are motivated to reduce emissions, and a review
    of viable next steps, this book speaks to scholars, business and advocacy group
    managers, philanthropists, policymakers, and anyone interested in climate change.

  abstract: Climate change is a global problem. However, between the global forces
    of climate change and the individual challenges of meeting basic needs, communities
    are the context in which people experience the effects of climate change and seek
    to adapt to its impact on their livelihoods. Such adaptation may include permanent
    migration, and this has certainly been one of the foci of international relations
    and security politics related to climate change. Of course, such migration will
    have human rights consequences; and there are also human rights causes of some
    of this migration, particularly as parts of the planet where people have made
    their homes and livelihoods become uninhabitable. Of equal importance are the
    problems related to climate change effects that do not cause mass migration but
    also have human rights causes and consequences. In this chaopter, we use a study
    in rural Bangladesh to demonstrate the import of the human rights considerations
    of this second, community-level, impact of climate change on human rights.

  abstract: National drinking water assessments for Bangladesh do not reflect local
    variability, or temporal differences. This paper reports on the findings of an
    interdisciplinary investigation of drinking water insecurity in a rural coastal
    south-western Bangladesh. Drinking water quality is assessed by comparison of
    locally measured concentrations to national levels and water quality criteria;
    resident’s access to potable water and their perceptions are based on local social
    surveys. Residents in the study area use groundwater far less than the national
    average; salinity and local rainwater scarcity necessitates the use of multiple
    water sources throughout the year. Groundwater concentrations of arsenic and specific
    conductivity (SpC) were greater than surface water (pond) concentrations; there
    was no statistically significant seasonal difference in mean concentrations in
    groundwater, but there was for ponds, with arsenic higher in the dry season. Average
    arsenic concentrations in local water drinking were 2–4 times times the national
    average. All of the local groundwater samples exceeded the Bangladesh guidance
    for SpC, although the majority of residents surveyed did not perceive their water
    as having a “bad” or “salty” taste.

  abstract: 'Drought and water scarcity are growing challenges to agriculture around
    the world. Farmers can adapt through both individual and community-based collective
    actions. We draw on extensive field-work conducted with paddy farmers in rural
    Sri Lanka to study adaptations to water scarcity, including switching to less
    water-intensive crops, farming collectively on shared land, and individually turning
    to groundwater by digging wells. We explore how variability in climate affects
    agricultural decision-making at the community and individual levels using three
    types of decision-making, each characterized by an objective function: risk-averse
    expected utility, regret-adjusted expected utility, and prospect theory loss-aversion.
    We also assess how the introduction of individualized access to irrigation water
    with wells affects community-based drought mitigation practices. Preliminary results
    suggest that the growth of well-irrigation may produce sudden disruptions to community-based
    adaptations, but that this depends on the mental models farmers use to think about
    risk and make decisions under uncertainty.'

  abstract: Droughts affect more people than any other natural disaster. Drought severity
    is not merely a function of precipitation; it emerges from a web of interrelations
    between human and natural systems. The impacts of drought are equally complex,
    shifting across temporal scales, economic sectors, and regions. Even in regions
    with similar hydroclimatic characteristics, there is tremendous variation in the
    effects of drought. This study combines satellite imagery, geospatial data, and
    qualitative data to identify the multi-scalar factors that drive variations in
    agricultural responses to drought. We analyzed eleven years of remotely sensed
    imagery to identify agricultural areas in which cultivation occurred during an
    extreme drought in Sri Lanka. We visited a subset of these communities and conducted
    interviews with officials and farmers to identify the factors that influenced
    agricultural adaptation. Results suggest that though structural factors such as
    infrastructural capacity and physical environment significantly affect agricultural
    adaptation, dynamic factors such as local control of water supply, perceived risk,
    community cohesion, and farmer experience explain significant variation in the
    adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

  abstract: This project applies machine learning techniques to remotely sensed imagery
    to train and validate predictive models of vegetation health in Bangladesh and
    Sri Lanka. For both locations, we downloaded and processed eleven years of imagery
    from multiple MODIS datasets which were combined and transformed into two-dimensional
    matrices. We applied a gradient boosted machines model to the lagged dataset values
    to forecast future values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The predictive
    power of raw spectral data MODIS products were compared across time periods and
    land use categories. Our models have significantly more predictive power on held-out
    datasets than a baseline. Though the tool was built to increase capacity to monitor
    vegetation health in data scarce regions like South Asia, users may include ancillary
    spatiotemporal datasets relevant to their region of interest to increase predictive
    power and to facilitate interpretation of model results. The tool can automatically
    update predictions as new MODIS data is made available by NASA. The tool is particularly
    well-suited for decision makers interested in understanding and predicting vegetation
    health dynamics in countries in which environmental data is scarce and cloud cover
    is a significant concern.

  abstract: A spatiotemporal analysis of two well-known agricultural drought indices,
    the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index
    at a 9-month scale (SPI-9), is presented for Sri Lanka. The analysis was conducted
    based on monthly precipitation and temperature data from January 1881 to December
    2010 using 13 stations distributed across the three climatic zones of the country.
    Principal component analysis shows that the first two principal components of
    PDSI and SPI-9 are spatially comparable and could physically represent the two
    main monsoons. A wavelet analysis of these principal components’ scores for both
    indices indicates a stronger association between the Northeastern monsoon and
    El-Niño in recent decades. Correlation analysis with agricultural metrics suggests
    that different indices might be appropriate for each of the climatic zones in
    Sri Lanka. PDSI correlated best with the intermediate zone districts; SPI-9 correlated
    best with the dry zone districts; but neither index correlated well with the wet
    zone districts.

  abstract: Although there are multiple causes of the water scarcity crisis in the
    American Southwest, it can be used as a model of the long-term problem of freshwater
    shortages that climate change will exacerbate. We examine the water-supply crisis
    for 22 cities in the extended Southwest of the United States and develop a unique,
    new measure of water conservation policies and programs. Convergent qualitative
    and quantitative analyses suggest that political conflicts play an important role
    in the transition of water-supply regimes toward higher levels of demand-reduction
    policies and programs. Qualitative analysis using institutional theory identifies
    the interaction of four types of motivating logics—development, rural preservation,
    environmental, and urban consumer—and shows how demand-reduction strategies can
    potentially satisfy all four. Quantitative analysis of the explanatory factors
    for the variation in the adoption of demand-reduction policies points to the overwhelming
    importance of political preferences as defined by Cook’s Partisan Voting Index.
    We suggest that approaches to water-supply choices are influenced less by direct
    partisan disagreements than by broad preferences for a development logic based
    on supply-increase strategies and discomfort with demand-reduction strategies
    that clash with conservative beliefs.

  abstract: Despite much scientific evidence, a large fraction of the American public
    doubts that greenhouse gases are causing global warming. We present a simulation
    model as a computational test-bed for climate prediction markets. Traders adapt
    their beliefs about future temperatures based on the profits of other traders
    in their social network. We simulate two alternative climate futures, in which
    global temperatures are primarily driven either by carbon dioxide or by solar
    irradiance. These represent, respectively, the scientific consensus and a hypothesis
    advanced by prominent skeptics. We conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how
    a variety of factors describing both the market and the physical climate may affect
    traders’ beliefs about the cause of global climate change. Market participation
    causes most traders to converge quickly toward believing the “true” climate model,
    suggesting that a climate market could be useful for building public consensus.

    changes in political economy and livelihoods in southwestern Bangladesh illustrate
    that in order to understand the impacts on people and nations of climate change-related
    environmental changes—changes that are expected to include rising sea level, saline
    inundation, and increased likelihood and intensity of cyclones in Bangladesh—we
    need to understand the dynamics of the built and natural environment and the political
    economies these sustain. Meso-level political economies affect the sources of
    income and livelihood available in distressed environmental conditions, and therefore
    influence how well the people in them can adapt to changing environmental conditions.
    In this study we have seen the underlying political economies whose dynamics,
    and not slow onset environmental changes or disastrous environmental events, are
    pushing Bangladeshis to incorporate migration strategies into their livelihood
    strategies.

  abstract: The Ganges-Brahmaputra river delta, with 170 million people and a vast,
    low-lying coastal plain, is perceived to be at great risk of increased flooding
    and submergence from sea-level rise. However, human alteration of the landscape
    can create similar risks to sea-level rise. Here, we report that islands in southwest
    Bangladesh, enclosed by embankments in the 1960s, have lost 1.0–1.5 m of elevation,
    whereas the neighbouring Sundarban mangrove forest has remained comparatively
    stable. We attribute this elevation loss to interruption of sedimentation inside
    the embankments, combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest biomass,
    and a regionally increased tidal range. One major consequence of this elevation
    loss occurred in 2009 when the embankments of several large islands failed during
    Cyclone Aila, leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for up to two years
    until embankments were repaired. Despite sustained human suffering during this
    time, the newly reconnected landscape received tens of centimetres of tidally
    deposited sediment, equivalent to decades’ worth of normal sedimentation. Although
    many areas still lie well below mean high water and remain at risk of severe flooding,
    we conclude that elevation recovery may be possible through controlled embankment
    breaches.

  abstract: Flood-control measures, such as levees and floodwalls, can backfire and
    increase risks of disastrous floods by giving the public a false sense of security
    and thus encouraging people to build valuable property in high-risk locations.
    More generally, nonlinear interactions between human land-use and natural processes
    can produce unexpected emergent phenomena in coupled human-natural systems (CHNS).
    We describe a participatory agent-based simulation of coupled urban development
    and flood risks and discuss the potential of this simulation to help educate a
    wide range of the public-from middle- and high-school students to public officials-about
    emergence in CHNS and present results from two pilot studies.

  title: Water conservation and hydrological transitions in cities in the United States
  container-title: Water Resources Research
  page: '4635-4649'
  volume: '51'
  issue: '6'
  status: published
  abstract: Cities across the world have had to diversify and expand their water supply
    systems in response to demand growth, groundwater depletion and pollution, and
    instability and inadequacy of regional surface freshwater sources. In the U.S.,
    these problems plague not only the arid Western cities but increasingly also cities
    in the Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek out new
    sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance supply systems, desalinization
    plants, and the recharge of aquifers with surface water, they also pursue water
    conservation because of its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation
    as a complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political, sociodemographic,
    economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We provide quantitative data on the
    factors that affect more and less advanced transitions in water conservation regimes,
    and we show that water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict
    the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify institutional
    and political barriers to more advanced water conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary,
    mixed methods approach typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists
    about how their research may or may not be adopted by decision-makers.

  abstract: This article outlines a method for automatically generating models of
    dynamic decision-making that both have strong predictive power and are interpretable
    in human terms. This is useful for designing empirically grounded agent-based
    simulations and for gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes. We
    use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based estimation
    process to generate simple approximations that explain most of the structure of
    complex stochastic processes. This method, implemented in C++ and R, scales well
    to large data sets. We apply our methods to empirical data from human subjects
    game experiments and international relations. We also demonstrate the method’s
    ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating data with agent-based
    models and correctly deriving the underlying decision models for multiple agent
    models and degrees of stochasticity.

  abstract: This Article examines how private governance can bypass government gridlock
    on climate change and buy time for a national and international carbon price.
    A carbon price—whether in the form of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program—is
    the optimal government response but is unlikely to be implemented within the next
    decade. Likely government policies will reduce emissions by far less than needed
    to reduce the risk of significant climate disruption, but recent corporate carbon
    disclosure programs, supply chain contracting requirements, investor pressure,
    and other private initiatives demonstrate the viability of another approach. Private
    initiatives can reduce carbon emissions without the coercive power or resources
    of government by correcting market and behavioral failures and by drawing on the
    support for mitigation that exists in a subset of the population. The Article
    demonstrates how a private governance wedge of emissions reductions can be achieved
    by expanding current corporate and household private governance initiatives and
    by launching new initiatives that address climate beliefs, motivations, and behavior.
    Private initiatives can bypass ideological barriers and national boundaries, but
    implementing a private climate governance strategy will require relaxing the assumption
    that only governments can drive major emissions reductions over the next decade.

  abstract: 'This Essay argues for consideration of political opportunity costs
    in the criteria used to evaluate climate policy instruments. Law and policy debates
    typically evaluate policy instruments by their expected performance after adoption,
    tacitly excluding consideration of the timing of adoption. Under this standard,
    a comprehensive carbon pricing instrument, either in the form of a cap and trade
    program or a carbon tax, has emerged as the preferred approach. Yet by excluding
    the political process from consideration, this standard obscures the effects of
    political feasibility on the timing of adoption. For many problems, the advantages
    of an optimal policy outweigh the advantages of a sub-optimal one that will require
    less time and effort to adopt. The climate problem is different: the irreversibility
    of climate change, the possibility of tipping points in the climate system, and
    lag times in infrastructure investments combine to impose large costs on delay.
    Excluding political opportunity costs from instrument evaluation leads to a preference
    for slow, comprehensive remedies. The casualties in this process are incremental
    instruments that could buy time, facilitate the adoption of additional instruments,
    and complement those instruments after they are adopted. This Essay proposes explicit
    consideration of political opportunity costs in evaluating climate policy instruments
    and applies this approach to several leading climate policies.'

  status: published
  abstract: 'Much of energy policy is driven by concerns about climate change. Views
    about the importance of carbon emissions affect debates on topics ranging from
    the regulation of electricity generation and transmission to the need for incentives
    to develop and promote emerging technologies. Government efforts to fund and communicate
    climate science have been extraordinary, but recent polling suggests that roughly
    half of the American population is unsure or does not believe that anthropogenic
    climate change is occurring. Among some populations belief in climate change is
    declining even as the climate science becomes more certain. Much of the doubt
    occurs among individuals who support free markets, and the doubt is fueled by
    the argument that governments and government-funded climate scientists are not
    accounting for information that is inconsistent with the climate consensus. This
    Article explores a private governance response: the creation of a prediction market
    to assess and communicate the implications of climate science. Markets not only
    allow the buying and selling of goods, they provide information about the likelihood
    of future events. Research suggests that markets are often able to account for
    information that is outside of the conventional wisdom. In addition, individuals
    who are likely to doubt climate science may find markets to be credible sources
    of information. A climate market could take the form of an academic initiative
    along the lines of the Iowa presidential prediction market or could operate as
    a more traditional options market. Trading could occur over the types of predictions
    that matter for global climate change, such as the global average temperature
    or sea level in 2020 or 2100, with the current market value of the prediction
    signaling the likelihood of the outcome. The market will be subject to manipulation
    concerns, but experience with other prediction markets suggests that a climate
    prediction market has the potential to provide an accurate, credible and widely-disseminated
    signal about the status of the climate science.'

    in vulnerable regions are shaped by multiple overlapping patterns of interaction
    between the physical environment in which people live and the social, economic,

    other communities, and external actors. Translating policy goals into effective
    action requires understanding these interactions at multiple levels.We report
    on a new transdisciplinary project that draws geoscientists, engineers, and social
    scientists together to investigate the interactions between communities and the
    environment in the southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh and understand the
    dynamics of vulnerability and resilience.'

  abstract: Deltas are dynamic landforms that have been the foci of agri- and aquacultural
    development by humans for millennia. The dynamics of deltas are governed by changes
    in river discharge and reworking of sediment. While these dynamics make deltas
    highly productive areas, they also present challenges to farming practices, often
    resulting in complicated feedbacks. These dynamics include river and coastal flooding,
    compaction, subsidence, salinization, and moving land-water boundaries. Likewise,
    farming in a dynamic environment can lead to socio-economic conflicts. Adaptation
    to these constantly changing variables requires flexible farming practices that
    must keep pace with changing climate.

  abstract: 'The individual and household sector accounts for roughly 40 percent
    of United States energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, yet the laws and policies
    directed at reductions from this sector often reflect a remarkably simplistic
    model of behavior. This Essay addresses one of the obstacles to achieving a “behavioral
    wedge”behavioral wedge of individual and household emissions reductions: the lack
    of an accessible, brief summary for policymakers of the key findings of behavioral
    and social science studies on household energy behavior. The Essay does not provide
    a comprehensive overview of the field, but it discusses many of the leading studies
    that demonstrate the extent and limits of rational action. These studies can inform
    lawyers and policymakers who are developing measures to reduce energy use and
    carbon emissions and can serve as an entry point for more detailed studies of
    the literature.An effective response to the climate change problem will require
    substantial reductions in energy demand in addition to new developments in low-carbon
    energy supplies. The individual and household sector presents a major opportunity:
    the sector accounts for roughly 40 Despite this opportunity, recent regulatory
    and policy efforts are only beginning to direct substantial attention to the individual
    and household sector. Findings from the social sciences provide valuable insights
    into how to capitalize on this opportunity, yet policymakers often have little
    time to develop new polices and are confronted with a barrage of often-conflicting
    approaches and theories. This Essay addresses the policy-making challenge by distilling
    the findings from a broad range of fields into several key principles for those
    developing energy and climate laws and policies. The principles we outline here
    are a starting point for policymakers working in this area. We attempt to provide
    insight into which principles are most relevant to law and policy, but instructions
    as to how to incorporate these principles are beyond the scope of this essay.
    The principles include only a subset of the insights from the behavioral and social
    science literature. In many cases, adherence to multiple principles will be necessary
    to develop the most effective policy design. Policymakers should consult the body
    of work referenced here, as well as experts in the social sciences to further
    their understanding of these and other principles. More extensive reviews of this
    literature and its relevance to energy and climate policy are also available.'

  abstract: Drawing on the recent financial crisis, we introduce the concept of macro-risk.
    We distinguish between micro-risks, which can be managed within conventional economic
    frameworks, and macro-risks, which threaten to disrupt economic systems so much
    that a different approach is required. We argue that catastrophic climate change
    is a prime example of a macro-risk. Research by climate scientists suggests disturbingly
    high likelihoods of temperature increases and sea level rises that could cause
    the kinds of systemic failures that almost occurred with the financial system.
    We suggest that macro-risks should be the principal concern of rational risk assessment
    and management, but they are not. The principal analytical tool, cost-benefit
    analysis using expected values, is far less valuable for addressing macro-risks
    than micro-risks because it fails to adequately treat tail-risks that are capable
    of disrupting the entire economy. We note the difficulty of assessing and responding
    to macro-risks such as catastrophic climate change, and we offer several proposals
    for improving macro-risk assessment methods and the information available to policy
    makers.

  abstract: Despite the large contribution of individuals and households to climate
    change, little has been done in the US to reduce the CO2 emissions attributable
    to this sector. Motor vehicle idling among individual private citizens is one
    behavior that may be amenable to large-scale policy interventions. Currently,
    little data are available to quantify the potential reductions in emissions that
    could be realized by successful policy interventions. In addition, little is known
    about the motivations and beliefs that underlie idling. In the fall of 2007, 1300
    drivers in the US were surveyed to assess typical idling practices, beliefs and
    motivations. Results indicate that the average individual idled for over 16 min
    a day and believed that a vehicle can be idled for at least 3.6 min before it
    is better to turn it off. Those who held inaccurate beliefs idled, on average,
    over 1 min longer than the remainder of the sample. These data suggest that idling
    accounts for over 93 MMt of CO2 and 10.6 billion gallons (40.1 billion liters)
    of gasoline a year, equaling 1.6

  abstract: Fluorescence imaging has become a common modality in cardiac electrodynamics.
    A single fluorescent parameter is typically measured. Given the growing emphasis
    on simultaneous imaging of more than one cardiac variable, we present an analysis
    of the potential of dual camera imaging, using as an example our straightforward
    dual camera system that allows simultaneous measurement of two dynamic quantities
    from the same region of the heart. The advantages of our system over others include
    an optional software camera calibration routine that eliminates the need for precise
    camera alignment. The system allows for rapid setup, dichroic image separation,
    dual-rate imaging, and high spatial resolution, and it is generally applicable
    to any two-camera measurement. This type of imaging system offers the potential
    for recording simultaneously not only transmembrane potential and intracellular
    calcium, two frequently measured quantities, but also other signals more directly
    related to myocardial metabolism, such as \[K+\]e, NADH, and reactive oxygen species,
    leading to the possibility of correlative multimodal cardiac imaging. We provide
    a compilation of dye and camera information critical to the design of dual camera
    systems and experiments.

  abstract: The individual and household sector generates roughly 30 to 40 percent
    of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and is a potential source of prompt and large
    emissions reductions. Yet the assumption that only extensive government regulation
    will generate substantial reductions from the sector is a barrier to change, particularly
    in a political environment hostile to regulation. This Article demonstrates that
    prompt and large reductions can be achieved without relying predominantly on regulatory
    measures. The Article identifies seven “low-hanging fruit:” actions that have
    the potential to achieve large reductions at less than half the cost of the leading
    current federal legislation, require limited up-front government expenditures,
    generate net savings for the individual, and do not confront other barriers. The
    seven actions discussed in this Article not only meet these criteria, but also
    will generate roughly 150 million tons in emissions reductions and several billion
    dollars in net social savings. The Article concludes that the actions identified
    here are only a beginning, and it identifies changes that will be necessary by
    policymakers and academicians if these and other low-hanging fruit are to be picked.

    and are the subject of ongoing research. Clinical defibrillators do not provide
    the precise control of shock timing, duration, and voltage or other features needed
    for detailed scientific inquiry, and there are few, if any, commercially available
    units designed for research applications. For this reason, we have developed a
    high-voltage, programmable, capacitive-discharge stimulator optimized to deliver
    defibrillation shocks with precise timing and voltage control to an isolated animal
    heart, either in air or in a bath. This stimulator is capable of delivering voltages
    of up to 500V and energies of nearly 100J with timing accuracy of a few microseconds
    and with rise and fall times of 5 $\mu$s or less and is controlled only by two
    external timing pulses and a control computer that sets the stimulation parameters
    via a LABVIEW interface. Most importantly, the stimulator has circuits to protect
    the high-voltage circuitry and the operator from programming and input-output
    errors. This device has been tested and used successfully in field shock experiments
    on rabbit hearts as well as other protocols requiring high voltage.

  abstract: Risk assessment is one tool of legal and policy decisionmaking, and one
    that may play a large role in establishing nanotechnology policy and regulations.
    In this Article, I analyze different methods of risk assessment and applies these
    methods to nanotechnology. I challenge the notion that people perceive and react
    to risk in a logical way, postulating that both experts and laypeople are susceptible
    to irrationality when it comes to risk perception. I conclude with a determination
    that a singular approach to risk management of nanotechnology may not be enough;
    rather, multiple risk management methods should be utilized depending on qualitative
    assessments of different nanotechnologies.

  page: '216-222'

  status: published
  abstract: Light scattering is used to monitor the dynamics and energy thresholds
    of laser-induced structural alterations in biopolymers due to irradiation by a
    free electron laser (FEL) in the infrared (IR) wavelength range 2.2 to 8.5 $\mu$m.
    Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy is
    used to examine infrared tissue absorption spectra before and after irradiation.
    Light scattering by bovine and porcine cartilage and cornea samples is measured
    in real time during FEL irradiation using a 650-nm diode laser and a diode photoarray
    with time resolution of 10 ms. The data on the time dependence of light scattering
    in the tissue are modeled to estimate the approximate values of kinetic parameters
    for denaturation as functions of laser wavelength and radiant exposure. We found
    that the denaturation threshold is slightly lower for cornea than for cartilage,
    and both depend on laser wavelength. An inverse correlation between denaturation
    thresholds and the absorption spectrum of the tissue is observed for many wavelengths;
    however, for wavelengths near 3 and 6 $\mu$m, the denaturation threshold does
    not exhibit the inverse correlation, instead being governed by heating kinetics
    of tissue. It is shown that light scattering is useful for measuring the denaturation
    thresholds and dynamics for different biotissues, except where the initial absorptivity
    is very high.

  abstract: Hydrogen chemistry in thin films and biological systems is one of the

    tested a novel solution, based on the spectroscopic version of scanning near-field
    optical microscopy (SNOM). The tunable infrared radiation of the Vanderbilt free-electron
    laser enabled us to reveal clearly hydrogen-decorated grain boundaries on nominally
    hydrogen-free diamond films. The images were obtained by SNOM detection of reflected
    3.5 micron photons, corresponding to the C-H stretch absorption, and reached a
    lateral resolution of 0.2 micron, well below the $\lambda/2$ ($\lambda$ = wavelength)
    limit of classical microscopy.

  abstract: We report first IR free-electron laser experiments to compare and elucidate
    the effects of surface-localized vibrational excitation versus bulk vibrational
    excitation on the ablation of polycrystalline diamond. The measured ablation yield
    values as a function of laser intensity indicate the existence of two separate
    thresholds. The lower intensity thresholds is identified as the ablation threshold,
    and the higher intensity threshold is associated with the formation of a plasma
    plume. The wavelength dependences of both thresholds indicate that eh C-H absorption
    occurring at surfaces and grain boundaries does not play a significant role in
    the ablation process. However, both thresholds are lower when the laser is resonant
    with the two-phonon bulk absorption band. These findings are consistent with the
    model that a rapid laser- induced phase transition to graphite is responsible
    for the low-intensity ablation of diamond at and above the first threshold.

  abstract: The study of semiconductor interfaces and of solid interfaces in general
    requires novel instrument capable to investigate the lateral fluctuations of properties
    on a microscopic scale. We present the first result of a major effort in that
    framework, whose main objective is the exploitation of the unique characteristics
    of free electron laser (FEL) infrared sources. The background was provided by
    our previous development of FEL-based techniques to measure interface barriers
    with high accuracy and reliability. Quite recently, we were able to implement
    similar investigations with high lateral resolution. The key elements were the
    use of a small-tip optics fiber and its coupling with a scanning module; in this
    way, we achieved and verified the condition of near-field microscopy including
    a lateral resolution much below the wavelength value. Our discussion includes
    a presentation of the first scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) images
    obtained with an FEL and data on small and microscopic-scale fluctuations of semiconductor
    interface barriers. The likely development of this exciting new field will also
    be discussed, in particular considering the new proposals for powerful FELs in
    the low-wavelength spectral range.

  title: Effect of wavelength on threshold and kinetics of tissue denaturation under
    laser radiation
  container-title: International biomedical optics symposium
  publisher: SPIE
  page: '122-129'
  volume: '3601'
  status: published
  abstract: We consider the denaturation process as an alteration in ordered organization
    of tissue structure and study the threshold and kinetics of laser-induced denaturation
    in cartilage and cornea undergoing irradiation from a free electron laser (FEL)
    in the wavelength range 2.2 - 8.5 (mu) . Light-scattering by cartilage samples
    was measured in real- time during FEL irradiation using a 630-nm diode laser and
    a diode array with time resolution of 10 ms. We found that denaturation threshold
    is slightly lower than that for cartilage, and both depend on laser wavelength.
    A strong inverse correlation between denaturation thresholds and the absorption
    spectrum of the tissue is observed. Only for the wavelength region near the 3
    (mu) water absorption band was the denaturation threshold not inversely proportional
    to the absorption coefficient. We believe this was because the radiation penetration
    depth was very small in this high- absorption region, so tissue denaturation occurred
    only in a layer too thin to produce significant light scattering. ATR spectra
    of 2.4 mm thick cartilage samples was measured before and after irradiation at
    6.0 and 2.2 (mu) . At 6.0 (mu) , where the absorption is high, the spectrum of
    the irradiated (front) surface showed changes, while the spectrum of the back
    surface was identical to that before irradiation. This difference results from
    dramatic denaturation (with chemical bond breaking) at the front surface due to
    laser heating in a small absorption depth. For 2.2 (mu) irradiation, where the
    absorption is small, the spectra of the front and back of the irradiated sample
    were unchanged from before irradiation, while light scattering alteration shown
    the denaturation process began, for laser fluences above the denaturation threshold.
    This indicates that the absorption is too small to produce deep denaturation of
    the tissue with dramatic alteration of structure. Thus, we have shown that light
    scattering is useful for measuring denaturation thresholds and kinetics for biotissues
    except where the initial absorptivity is very high.

  abstract: 'We We report first studies of photodesorption from diamond films using
    the Vanderbilt Free-Electron Laser at two infrared wavelengths: 3.5 micron, corresponding
    to localized absorption by C-H bonds at grain boundaries, and 5 micron, corresponding
    to two-phonon absorption by the bulk diamond. At 3.5 micron we observe two photodesorption
    thresholds at fluences well below the onset of ablation. In contrast, at 5 micron,
    a single photodesorption threshold is identified at a fluence which is close to
    the second fluence threshold, obseved at 3.5 micron. These experiments shed light
    on the physics of wavelength selective desorption through non-electronic channels.'
