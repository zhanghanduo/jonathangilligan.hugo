  abstract: Private sector action provides one of the most promising opportunities
    to reduce the risks of climate change, buying time while governments move slowly
    or even oppose climate mitigation. Starting with the insight that much of the
    resistance to climate mitigation is grounded in concern about the role of government,
    this books draws on law, policy, social science, and climate science to demonstrate
    how private initiatives are already bypassing government inaction in the US and
    around the globe. It makes a persuasive case that private governance can reduce
    global carbon emissions by a billion tons per year over the next decade. Combining
    an examination of the growth of private climate initiatives over the last decade,
    a theory of why private actors are motivated to reduce emissions, and a review
    of viable next steps, this book speaks to scholars, business and advocacy group
    managers, philanthropists, policymakers, and anyone interested in climate change.

  abstract: Climate change is a global problem. However, between the global forces
    of climate change and the individual challenges of meeting basic needs, communities
    are the context in which people experience the effects of climate change and seek
    to adapt to its impact on their livelihoods. Such adaptation may include permanent
    migration, and this has certainly been one of the foci of international relations
    and security politics related to climate change. Of course, such migration will
    have human rights consequences; and there are also human rights causes of some
    of this migration, particularly as parts of the planet where people have made
    their homes and livelihoods become uninhabitable. Of equal importance are the
    problems related to climate change effects that do not cause mass migration but
    also have human rights causes and consequences. In this chaopter, we use a study
    in rural Bangladesh to demonstrate the import of the human rights considerations
    of this second, community-level, impact of climate change on human rights.

  abstract: "National drinking water assessments for Bangladesh do not reflect local\
    \ variability, or temporal differences. This paper reports on the findings of\
    \ an interdisciplinary investigation of drinking water insecurity in a rural coastal\
    \ south-western Bangladesh. Drinking water quality is assessed by comparison of\
    \ locally measured concentrations to national levels and water quality criteria;\
    \ resident\u2019s access to potable water and their perceptions are based on local\
    \ social surveys. Residents in the study area use groundwater far less than the\
    \ national average; salinity and local rainwater scarcity necessitates the use\
    \ of multiple water sources throughout the year. Groundwater concentrations of\
    \ arsenic and specific conductivity (SpC) were greater than surface water (pond)\
    \ concentrations; there was no statistically significant seasonal difference in\
    \ mean concentrations in groundwater, but there was for ponds, with arsenic higher\
    \ in the dry season. Average arsenic concentrations in local water drinking were\
    \ 2\u20134 times times the national average. All of the local groundwater samples\
    \ exceeded the Bangladesh guidance for SpC, although the majority of residents\
    \ surveyed did not perceive their water as having a \u201Cbad\u201D or \u201C\
    salty\u201D taste."

  abstract: 'Drought and water scarcity are growing challenges to agriculture around
    the world. Farmers can adapt through both individual and community-based collective
    actions. We draw on extensive field-work conducted with paddy farmers in rural
    Sri Lanka to study adaptations to water scarcity, including switching to less
    water-intensive crops, farming collectively on shared land, and individually turning
    to groundwater by digging wells. We explore how variability in climate affects
    agricultural decision-making at the community and individual levels using three
    types of decision-making, each characterized by an objective function: risk-averse
    expected utility, regret-adjusted expected utility, and prospect theory loss-aversion.
    We also assess how the introduction of individualized access to irrigation water
    with wells affects community-based drought mitigation practices. Preliminary results
    suggest that the growth of well-irrigation may produce sudden disruptions to community-based
    adaptations, but that this depends on the mental models farmers use to think about
    risk and make decisions under uncertainty.'

  abstract: Droughts affect more people than any other natural disaster. Drought severity
    is not merely a function of precipitation; it emerges from a web of interrelations
    between human and natural systems. The impacts of drought are equally complex,
    shifting across temporal scales, economic sectors, and regions. Even in regions
    with similar hydroclimatic characteristics, there is tremendous variation in the
    effects of drought. This study combines satellite imagery, geospatial data, and
    qualitative data to identify the multi-scalar factors that drive variations in
    agricultural responses to drought. We analyzed eleven years of remotely sensed
    imagery to identify agricultural areas in which cultivation occurred during an
    extreme drought in Sri Lanka. We visited a subset of these communities and conducted
    interviews with officials and farmers to identify the factors that influenced
    agricultural adaptation. Results suggest that though structural factors such as
    infrastructural capacity and physical environment significantly affect agricultural
    adaptation, dynamic factors such as local control of water supply, perceived risk,
    community cohesion, and farmer experience explain significant variation in the
    adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

  abstract: This project applies machine learning techniques to remotely sensed imagery
    to train and validate predictive models of vegetation health in Bangladesh and
    Sri Lanka. For both locations, we downloaded and processed eleven years of imagery
    from multiple MODIS datasets which were combined and transformed into two-dimensional
    matrices. We applied a gradient boosted machines model to the lagged dataset values
    to forecast future values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The predictive
    power of raw spectral data MODIS products were compared across time periods and
    land use categories. Our models have significantly more predictive power on held-out
    datasets than a baseline. Though the tool was built to increase capacity to monitor
    vegetation health in data scarce regions like South Asia, users may include ancillary
    spatiotemporal datasets relevant to their region of interest to increase predictive
    power and to facilitate interpretation of model results. The tool can automatically
    update predictions as new MODIS data is made available by NASA. The tool is particularly
    well-suited for decision makers interested in understanding and predicting vegetation
    health dynamics in countries in which environmental data is scarce and cloud cover
    is a significant concern.

  abstract: "The Ganges-Brahmaputra river delta, with 170 million people and a vast,\
    \ low-lying coastal plain, is perceived to be at great risk of increased flooding\
    \ and submergence from sea-level rise. However, human alteration of the landscape\
    \ can create similar risks to sea-level rise. Here, we report that islands in\
    \ southwest Bangladesh, enclosed by embankments in the 1960s, have lost 1.0\u2013\
    1.5 m of elevation, whereas the neighbouring Sundarban mangrove forest has remained\
    \ comparatively stable. We attribute this elevation loss to interruption of sedimentation\
    \ inside the embankments, combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest\
    \ biomass, and a regionally increased tidal range. One major consequence of this\
    \ elevation loss occurred in 2009 when the embankments of several large islands\
    \ failed during Cyclone Aila, leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for\
    \ up to two years until embankments were repaired. Despite sustained human suffering\
    \ during this time, the newly reconnected landscape received tens of centimetres\
    \ of tidally deposited sediment, equivalent to decades\u2019 worth of normal sedimentation.\
    \ Although many areas still lie well below mean high water and remain at risk\
    \ of severe flooding, we conclude that elevation recovery may be possible through\
    \ controlled embankment breaches."

  abstract: Flood-control measures, such as levees and floodwalls, can backfire and
    increase risks of disastrous floods by giving the public a false sense of security
    and thus encouraging people to build valuable property in high-risk locations.
    More generally, nonlinear interactions between human land-use and natural processes
    can produce unexpected emergent phenomena in coupled human-natural systems (CHNS).
    We describe a participatory agent-based simulation of coupled urban development
    and flood risks and discuss the potential of this simulation to help educate a
    wide range of the public-from middle- and high-school students to public officials-about
    emergence in CHNS and present results from two pilot studies.

  abstract: Cities across the world have had to diversify and expand their water supply
    systems in response to demand growth, groundwater depletion and pollution, and
    instability and inadequacy of regional surface freshwater sources. In the U.S.,
    these problems plague not only the arid Western cities but increasingly also cities
    in the Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek out new
    sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance supply systems, desalinization
    plants, and the recharge of aquifers with surface water, they also pursue water
    conservation because of its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation
    as a complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political, sociodemographic,
    economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We provide quantitative data on the
    factors that affect more and less advanced transitions in water conservation regimes,
    and we show that water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict
    the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify institutional
    and political barriers to more advanced water conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary,
    mixed methods approach typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists

  abstract: "This article outlines a method for automatically generating models of\
    \ dynamic decision-making that both have strong predictive power and are interpretable\
    \ in human terms. This is useful for designing empirically grounded agent-based\
    \ simulations and for gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes.\
    \ We use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based estimation\
    \ process to generate simple approximations that explain most of the structure\
    \ of complex stochastic processes. This method, implemented in C++ and R, scales\
    \ well to large data sets. We apply our methods to empirical data from human subjects\
    \ game experiments and international relations. We also demonstrate the method\u2019\
    s ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating data with agent-based\
    \ models and correctly deriving the underlying decision models for multiple agent\
    \ models and degrees of stochasticity."

  abstract: "This Article examines how private governance can bypass government gridlock\
    \ on climate change and buy time for a national and international carbon price.\
    \ A carbon price\u2014whether in the form of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program\u2014\
    is the optimal government response but is unlikely to be implemented within the\
    \ next decade. Likely government policies will reduce emissions by far less than\

    \ reductions can be achieved by expanding current corporate and household private\
    \ governance initiatives and by launching new initiatives that address climate\

  abstract: 'This Essay argues for consideration of political opportunity costs in
    the criteria used to evaluate climate policy instruments. Law and policy debates
    typically evaluate policy instruments by their expected performance after adoption,
    tacitly excluding consideration of the timing of adoption. Under this standard,
    a comprehensive carbon pricing instrument, either in the form of a cap and trade
    program or a carbon tax, has emerged as the preferred approach. Yet by excluding
    the political process from consideration, this standard obscures the effects of
    political feasibility on the timing of adoption. For many problems, the advantages
    of an optimal policy outweigh the advantages of a sub-optimal one that will require
    less time and effort to adopt. The climate problem is different: the irreversibility
    of climate change, the possibility of tipping points in the climate system, and
    lag times in infrastructure investments combine to impose large costs on delay.
    Excluding political opportunity costs from instrument evaluation leads to a preference
    for slow, comprehensive remedies. The casualties in this process are incremental
    instruments that could buy time, facilitate the adoption of additional instruments,
    and complement those instruments after they are adopted. This Essay proposes explicit
    consideration of political opportunity costs in evaluating climate policy instruments
    and applies this approach to several leading climate policies.'

- abstract: 'Much of energy policy is driven by concerns about climate change. Views
    about the importance of carbon emissions affect debates on topics ranging from
    the regulation of electricity generation and transmission to the need for incentives
    to develop and promote emerging technologies. Government efforts to fund and communicate
    climate science have been extraordinary, but recent polling suggests that roughly
    half of the American population is unsure or does not believe that anthropogenic
    climate change is occurring. Among some populations belief in climate change is
    declining even as the climate science becomes more certain. Much of the doubt
    occurs among individuals who support free markets, and the doubt is fueled by
    the argument that governments and government-funded climate scientists are not
    accounting for information that is inconsistent with the climate consensus. This
    Article explores a private governance response: the creation of a prediction market
    to assess and communicate the implications of climate science. Markets not only
    allow the buying and selling of goods, they provide information about the likelihood
    of future events. Research suggests that markets are often able to account for
    information that is outside of the conventional wisdom. In addition, individuals
    who are likely to doubt climate science may find markets to be credible sources
    of information. A climate market could take the form of an academic initiative
    along the lines of the Iowa presidential prediction market or could operate as
    a more traditional options market. Trading could occur over the types of predictions
    that matter for global climate change, such as the global average temperature
    or sea level in 2020 or 2100, with the current market value of the prediction
    signaling the likelihood of the outcome. The market will be subject to manipulation
    concerns, but experience with other prediction markets suggests that a climate
    prediction market has the potential to provide an accurate, credible and widely-disseminated
    signal about the status of the climate science.'

- abstract: Deltas are dynamic landforms that have been the foci of agri- and aquacultural
    development by humans for millennia. The dynamics of deltas are governed by changes
    in river discharge and reworking of sediment. While these dynamics make deltas
    highly productive areas, they also present challenges to farming practices, often
    resulting in complicated feedbacks. These dynamics include river and coastal flooding,
    compaction, subsidence, salinization, and moving land-water boundaries. Likewise,
    farming in a dynamic environment can lead to socio-economic conflicts. Adaptation
    to these constantly changing variables requires flexible farming practices that
    must keep pace with changing climate.

- abstract: "The individual and household sector accounts for roughly 40 percent of\
    \ United States energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, yet the laws and policies\
    \ directed at reductions from this sector often reflect a remarkably simplistic\
    \ model of behavior. This Essay addresses one of the obstacles to achieving a\
    \ \u201Cbehavioral wedge\u201Dbehavioral wedge of individual and household emissions\
    \ reductions: the lack of an accessible, brief summary for policymakers of the\
    \ key findings of behavioral and social science studies on household energy behavior.\
    \ The Essay does not provide a comprehensive overview of the field, but it discusses\
    \ many of the leading studies that demonstrate the extent and limits of rational\
    \ action. These studies can inform lawyers and policymakers who are developing\
    \ measures to reduce energy use and carbon emissions and can serve as an entry\
    \ point for more detailed studies of the literature.An effective response to the\
    \ climate change problem will require substantial reductions in energy demand\
    \ in addition to new developments in low-carbon energy supplies. The individual\
    \ and household sector presents a major opportunity: the sector accounts for roughly\
    \ 40 Despite this opportunity, recent regulatory and policy efforts are only beginning\
    \ to direct substantial attention to the individual and household sector. Findings\
    \ from the social sciences provide valuable insights into how to capitalize on\
    \ this opportunity, yet policymakers often have little time to develop new polices\
    \ and are confronted with a barrage of often-conflicting approaches and theories.\
    \ This Essay addresses the policy-making challenge by distilling the findings\
    \ from a broad range of fields into several key principles for those developing\
    \ energy and climate laws and policies. The principles we outline here are a starting\
    \ point for policymakers working in this area. We attempt to provide insight into\
    \ which principles are most relevant to law and policy, but instructions as to\
    \ how to incorporate these principles are beyond the scope of this essay. The\
    \ principles include only a subset of the insights from the behavioral and social\
    \ science literature. In many cases, adherence to multiple principles will be\
    \ necessary to develop the most effective policy design. Policymakers should consult\
    \ the body of work referenced here, as well as experts in the social sciences\
    \ to further their understanding of these and other principles. More extensive\
    \ reviews of this literature and its relevance to energy and climate policy are\

- abstract: Drawing on the recent financial crisis, we introduce the concept of macro-risk.
    We distinguish between micro-risks, which can be managed within conventional economic
    frameworks, and macro-risks, which threaten to disrupt economic systems so much
    that a different approach is required. We argue that catastrophic climate change
    is a prime example of a macro-risk. Research by climate scientists suggests disturbingly
    high likelihoods of temperature increases and sea level rises that could cause
    the kinds of systemic failures that almost occurred with the financial system.
    We suggest that macro-risks should be the principal concern of rational risk assessment
    and management, but they are not. The principal analytical tool, cost-benefit
    analysis using expected values, is far less valuable for addressing macro-risks
    than micro-risks because it fails to adequately treat tail-risks that are capable
    of disrupting the entire economy. We note the difficulty of assessing and responding
    to macro-risks such as catastrophic climate change, and we offer several proposals
    for improving macro-risk assessment methods and the information available to policy
    makers.

  abstract: Despite the large contribution of individuals and households to climate
    change, little has been done in the US to reduce the CO2 emissions attributable
    to this sector. Motor vehicle idling among individual private citizens is one
    behavior that may be amenable to large-scale policy interventions. Currently,
    little data are available to quantify the potential reductions in emissions that
    could be realized by successful policy interventions. In addition, little is known
    about the motivations and beliefs that underlie idling. In the fall of 2007, 1300
    drivers in the US were surveyed to assess typical idling practices, beliefs and
    motivations. Results indicate that the average individual idled for over 16 min
    a day and believed that a vehicle can be idled for at least 3.6 min before it
    is better to turn it off. Those who held inaccurate beliefs idled, on average,
    over 1 min longer than the remainder of the sample. These data suggest that idling
    accounts for over 93 MMt of CO2 and 10.6 billion gallons (40.1 billion liters)
    of gasoline a year, equaling 1.6

  abstract: Most climate change policy attention has been addressed to long-term options,
    such as inducing new, low-carbon energy technologies and creating cap-and-trade
    regimes for emissions. We use a behavioral approach to examine the reasonably
    achievable potential for near-term reductions by altered adoption and use of available
    technologies in US homes and nonbusiness travel. We estimate the plasticity of
    17 household action types in 5 behaviorally distinct categories by use of data
    on the most effective documented interventions that do not involve new regulatory
    measures. These interventions vary by type of action and typically combine several
    policy tools and strong social marketing. National implementation could save an
    estimated 123 million metric tons of carbon per year in year 10, which is 20

- abstract: Fluorescence imaging has become a common modality in cardiac electrodynamics.
    A single fluorescent parameter is typically measured. Given the growing emphasis
    on simultaneous imaging of more than one cardiac variable, we present an analysis
    of the potential of dual camera imaging, using as an example our straightforward
    dual camera system that allows simultaneous measurement of two dynamic quantities
    from the same region of the heart. The advantages of our system over others include
    an optional software camera calibration routine that eliminates the need for precise
    camera alignment. The system allows for rapid setup, dichroic image separation,
    dual-rate imaging, and high spatial resolution, and it is generally applicable
    to any two-camera measurement. This type of imaging system offers the potential
    for recording simultaneously not only transmembrane potential and intracellular
    calcium, two frequently measured quantities, but also other signals more directly
    related to myocardial metabolism, such as \[K+\]e, NADH, and reactive oxygen species,
    leading to the possibility of correlative multimodal cardiac imaging. We provide
    a compilation of dye and camera information critical to the design of dual camera
    systems and experiments.

- abstract: "The individual and household sector generates roughly 30 to 40 percent\
    \ of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and is a potential source of prompt and large\
    \ emissions reductions. Yet the assumption that only extensive government regulation\
    \ will generate substantial reductions from the sector is a barrier to change,\
    \ particularly in a political environment hostile to regulation. This Article\
    \ demonstrates that prompt and large reductions can be achieved without relying\
    \ predominantly on regulatory measures. The Article identifies seven \u201Clow-hanging\
    \ fruit:\u201D actions that have the potential to achieve large reductions at\
    \ less than half the cost of the leading current federal legislation, require\
    \ limited up-front government expenditures, generate net savings for the individual,\
    \ and do not confront other barriers. The seven actions discussed in this Article\
    \ not only meet these criteria, but also will generate roughly 150 million tons\
    \ in emissions reductions and several billion dollars in net social savings. The\
    \ Article concludes that the actions identified here are only a beginning, and\
    \ it identifies changes that will be necessary by policymakers and academicians\
    \ if these and other low-hanging fruit are to be picked."

- abstract: "Defibrillators are a critical tool for treating heart disease; however,\
    \ the mechanisms by which they halt fibrillation are still not fully understood\
    \ and are the subject of ongoing research. Clinical defibrillators do not provide\
    \ the precise control of shock timing, duration, and voltage or other features\
    \ needed for detailed scientific inquiry, and there are few, if any, commercially\
    \ available units designed for research applications. For this reason, we have\
    \ developed a high-voltage, programmable, capacitive-discharge stimulator optimized\
    \ to deliver defibrillation shocks with precise timing and voltage control to\
    \ an isolated animal heart, either in air or in a bath. This stimulator is capable\
    \ of delivering voltages of up to 500V and energies of nearly 100J with timing\
    \ accuracy of a few microseconds and with rise and fall times of 5\_$\\mu$s or\
    \ less and is controlled only by two external timing pulses and a control computer\
    \ that sets the stimulation parameters via a LABVIEW interface. Most importantly,\
    \ the stimulator has circuits to protect the high-voltage circuitry and the operator\
    \ from programming and input-output errors. This device has been tested and used\
    \ successfully in field shock experiments on rabbit hearts as well as other protocols\
    \ requiring high voltage."

- abstract: Risk assessment is one tool of legal and policy decisionmaking, and one
    that may play a large role in establishing nanotechnology policy and regulations.
    In this Article, I analyze different methods of risk assessment and applies these
    methods to nanotechnology. I challenge the notion that people perceive and react
    to risk in a logical way, postulating that both experts and laypeople are susceptible
    to irrationality when it comes to risk perception. I conclude with a determination
    that a singular approach to risk management of nanotechnology may not be enough;
    rather, multiple risk management methods should be utilized depending on qualitative
    assessments of different nanotechnologies.

  abstract: "Light scattering is used to monitor the dynamics and energy thresholds\

- abstract: Using photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy, we report detailed
    measurements of the fundamental absorption threshold below the optical gap in
    hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). These measurements suggest that the density
    of neutral defects is much greater than the densities of charged defects in intrinsic
    a-Si:H. The positions and widths of the corresponding transition energies are
    determined and agree with two models proposed to describe the density of states

- abstract: We report first IR free-electron laser experiments to compare and elucidate
    the effects of surface-localized vibrational excitation versus bulk vibrational
    excitation on the ablation of polycrystalline diamond. The measured ablation yield
    values as a function of laser intensity indicate the existence of two separate
    thresholds. The lower intensity thresholds is identified as the ablation threshold,
    and the higher intensity threshold is associated with the formation of a plasma
    plume. The wavelength dependences of both thresholds indicate that eh C-H absorption
    occurring at surfaces and grain boundaries does not play a significant role in
    the ablation process. However, both thresholds are lower when the laser is resonant
    with the two-phonon bulk absorption band. These findings are consistent with the
    model that a rapid laser- induced phase transition to graphite is responsible
    for the low-intensity ablation of diamond at and above the first threshold.

- abstract: The study of semiconductor interfaces and of solid interfaces in general
    requires novel instrument capable to investigate the lateral fluctuations of properties
    on a microscopic scale. We present the first result of a major effort in that
    framework, whose main objective is the exploitation of the unique characteristics
    of free electron laser (FEL) infrared sources. The background was provided by
    our previous development of FEL-based techniques to measure interface barriers
    with high accuracy and reliability. Quite recently, we were able to implement
    similar investigations with high lateral resolution. The key elements were the
    use of a small-tip optics fiber and its coupling with a scanning module; in this
    way, we achieved and verified the condition of near-field microscopy including
    a lateral resolution much below the wavelength value. Our discussion includes
    a presentation of the first scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) images
    obtained with an FEL and data on small and microscopic-scale fluctuations of semiconductor
    interface barriers. The likely development of this exciting new field will also
    be discussed, in particular considering the new proposals for powerful FELs in
    the low-wavelength spectral range.

- abstract: We consider the denaturation process as an alteration in ordered organization
    of tissue structure and study the threshold and kinetics of laser-induced denaturation
    in cartilage and cornea undergoing irradiation from a free electron laser (FEL)
    in the wavelength range 2.2 - 8.5 (mu) . Light-scattering by cartilage samples
    was measured in real- time during FEL irradiation using a 630-nm diode laser and
    a diode array with time resolution of 10 ms. We found that denaturation threshold
    is slightly lower than that for cartilage, and both depend on laser wavelength.
    A strong inverse correlation between denaturation thresholds and the absorption
    spectrum of the tissue is observed. Only for the wavelength region near the 3
    (mu) water absorption band was the denaturation threshold not inversely proportional
    to the absorption coefficient. We believe this was because the radiation penetration
    depth was very small in this high- absorption region, so tissue denaturation occurred
    only in a layer too thin to produce significant light scattering. ATR spectra
    of 2.4 mm thick cartilage samples was measured before and after irradiation at
    6.0 and 2.2 (mu) . At 6.0 (mu) , where the absorption is high, the spectrum of
    the irradiated (front) surface showed changes, while the spectrum of the back
    surface was identical to that before irradiation. This difference results from
    dramatic denaturation (with chemical bond breaking) at the front surface due to
    laser heating in a small absorption depth. For 2.2 (mu) irradiation, where the
    absorption is small, the spectra of the front and back of the irradiated sample
    were unchanged from before irradiation, while light scattering alteration shown
    the denaturation process began, for laser fluences above the denaturation threshold.
    This indicates that the absorption is too small to produce deep denaturation of
    the tissue with dramatic alteration of structure. Thus, we have shown that light
    scattering is useful for measuring denaturation thresholds and kinetics for biotissues
    except where the initial absorptivity is very high.

- abstract: First experiments at the Vanderbilt free electron lasers measured the
    local reflectivity of a PtSi/Si system. The reflectivity in the scanning near-field
    optical microscope images revealed features that were not present in the corresponding
    shear-force (topology) images and which were due to localized changes in the bulk
    properties of the sample. The size of the smallest detected features clearly demonstrated
    that near-field conditions were reached. The use of different photon wavelengths
    (0.653, 1.2, and 2.4 $\mu$m) enabled us to probe regions of different depth.

  title: Free-electron-laser near-field nanospectroscopy
  type: article-journal
  volume: '73'
- abstract: First experiments of coupling a free electron laser to a scanning near-field
    optical microscope (SNOM) are presented. To address the question of how important
    such spectroscopy can be for near-field infrared microscopy, we acquired images
    of the same region of the sample under investigation at several photon wavelengths.
    SNOM reflectivity images revealed features that were not present in the corresponding
    shear-force (topology) ones and which were due to localized changes in the bulk
    properties of the sample. Optical data in the infrared (near 3.5 $\mu$m), using
    the probe tips in collection mode, indicates an optical spatial resolution well
    below the classical limit of $\lambda/2$.

- abstract: 'We We report first studies of photodesorption from diamond films using
    the Vanderbilt Free-Electron Laser at two infrared wavelengths: 3.5 micron, corresponding
    to localized absorption by C-H bonds at grain boundaries, and 5 micron, corresponding
    to two-phonon absorption by the bulk diamond. At 3.5 micron we observe two photodesorption
    thresholds at fluences well below the onset of ablation. In contrast, at 5 micron,
    a single photodesorption threshold is identified at a fluence which is close to
    the second fluence threshold, obseved at 3.5 micron. These experiments shed light
    on the physics of wavelength selective desorption through non-electronic channels.'

- abstract: "In recent years, advances in theoretical treatments have made molecular\
    \ hydrogen attractive for studies of fundamental physics in molecules. The relativistic\
    \ and radiative corrections to the ground-state binding energy have been calculated,\
    \ but few measurements have been able to test these predictions. With frequency-tripled\
    \ pulse-amplified light from a continuous-wave single-frequency dye laser, it\
    \ is possible to make precise measurements of two-photon transitions in the deep\
    \ ultraviolet. Several two-photon transitions from the ground state to the $EF$\
    \ state of the stable isotopes of molecular hydrogen were measured with accuracies\
    \ around $0.015~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Saturated absorption spectra of $\\ce{I2}$ were\
    \ acquired simultaneously to allow the accuracy to be improved to $0.003~\\text{cm}^{-1}$\
    \ in the future by measuring the absolute frequencies of visible transitions in\
    \ $\\ce{I2}$. A second experiment used laser double resonance to measure the energies\
    \ of transitions in $\\ce{HD}$ from the $EF$ state to singlet Rydberg $p$ states\
    \ ranging from $n=40$ to 80. A quantum defect analysis of these transitions was\
    \ used to extrapolate to the series limit. Combining the series limit with the\
    \ measured $EF$ state energy gives a value of $124\\,568.479(19)~\\text{cm}^{-1}$\
    \ for the ionization potential, in good agreement with *ab initio* calculations.\
    \ The measurements of transitions to the $EF$ state in \_allows a previous measurement\
    \ of the ionization potential of $\\ce{D2}$ to be improved by a factor of four\
    \ to $\\pm 0.027~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The ionization potentials of $\\ce{H2}$, $\\\
    ce{D2}$, and $\\ce{HD}$ have now been measured with accuracies of $0.014--0.027~\\\
    text{cm}^{-1}$. These accuracies are better than those of the *ab initio* calculations.\
    \ The agreement between the measurements and the *ab initio* values confirms the\
    \ calculated relativistic and radiative corrections."
