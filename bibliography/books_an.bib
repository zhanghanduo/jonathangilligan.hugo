  credit       = {This book synthesizes and extends ten years of collaborative work by Vandenbergh and me. We developed the ideas on policy plasticity, political opportunity cost, second-best solutions, and behavioral approaches to greenhouse gas emissions reduction together. Vandenbergh developed the ideas of corporate governance (Chapter 5) independently, although I did most of the quantitative analysis for that chapter. I wrote almost all of chapter 2 (the Climate Challenge). Of the remainder, Vandenbergh did roughly 60\% of the writing and I did almost all of the quantitative analysis.},
