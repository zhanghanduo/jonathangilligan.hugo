Students working with me are engaged in a variety of projects to combine knowledge
about the physical environment and social, political, and economic conditions.
This can include analysis of remote-sensing imagery from satellites, working with
GIS databases, developing agent-based models, and conducting spatiotemporal
statistical analysis.

Students write and publish papers, often as first-author, in scientific journals
and present research results at national and international conferences.

## Current Students

- **Kelsea Best** is researching connections between environmental change,
  livelihoods, and population movement in Bangladesh. Kelsea applies machine
  learning to survey data to identify patterns in the characteristics of 
  people who relocate and will use those insights to develop agent-based models
  to simulate migration patterns.

- **Pam Hoover** is studying the environmental impact of reading documents 
  electronically versus printing them out. 
  
- **David Knorr** is investigating connections between gentrification and access to
  public transit in Nashville. David uses GIS and other tools to apply advanced
  spatio-temporal statistical methods to studying patterns in home sales and
  prices and ridership on public buses. He will use the results of this research
  to develop an agent-based model of the impact of gentrification on the
  ability to conduct the activities of daily living by people with low income
  and limited access to personal vehicles.
  
- **Chris Tasich** is studying governance of vulnerable landscapes in Bangladesh.
  Chris has developed a model of sediment deposition in intertidal 
  lands along the tidal channels in coastal Bangladesh. He is applying
  agent-based models of local decision-making to study how communities might 
  make use of different approaches to managing vulnerable lands in the face
  of sea-level rise and other environmental change.

## Recently Graduated Students

- __[Emily K. Burchfield](http://qcnr.usu.edu/directory/burchfield_emily)__ 
  graduated with her Ph.D. in 2017.
  Her graduate studies focused on combining intensive computational methods of
  geospatial analysis with satellite remote-sensing imagery and on-the-ground
  research on farmers coping with water scarcity in Bangladesh. Emily made
  extensive use of Bayesian statistical methods to analyze her data and developed
  agent-based models of the economic and social impacts of farmers' decision processes.

    Emily is now an Assistant Professor at Utah State University's Department
of Environment and Society.

- __[John J. Nay](http://johnjnay.com)__ graduated with his Ph.D. in 2017.
  His graduate studies focused on computational decision science, combining
  machine learning, behavioral economics, and field work in Sri Lanka and
  Bangladesh. John applied machine learning tools and agent-based modeling
  to a wide variety of problems, from identifying the strategies real people
  use in playing  games to analyzing law and policy.

    While he was still a graduate student, John founded a company,
    [Skopos Labs](https://www.skoposlabs.com), which applies artificial
    intelligence to predicting which bills before the U.S. Congress.

    John divides his time between being CEO of Skopos Labs and
    a postdoctoral fellowship in legal informatics at the
    New York University Law School.

- __Laura Benneyworth__ graduated with her Ph.D. in 2016.
  Her graduate studies focused on integrating detailed chemical analysis
  of water quality in Bangladesh with social-scientific research on people's
  perceptions of water quality and the sources of water they use.

      Laura discovered that rural households in Bangladesh often have
      great difficulty finding safe water to drink and often don't even
      realize how poor the quality of their water is. These difficulties
      are far greater than one would guess from the official figures on
      water availablity.

      After graduating, Laura has worked as a GIS analyst for the Tennessee
      Department of Transportation and as a GIS consultant.
