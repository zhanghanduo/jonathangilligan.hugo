<p>Comparisons of observed trends of energy and carbon intensity in the global
economy to trends implied by emissions scenarios used in policy analysis
suggested that those scenarios were severely over-optimistic about the rate at
which the world would spontaneously decarbonize its economy.</p>
<p>I update these analysis, using global emissions since 2005, and find
that observed rates of decarbonization are not far behind those implied by
the RCP 4.5 policy scenario. This suggests that the policy challenge may not
be as difficult as previous work has reported.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This analysis follows the methods of Roger Pielke, Jr., Tom Wigley, and
Christopher Green,
“<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/afdc/e9bfa0fb51768394407d086cdeb5e9f77207.pdf">Dangerous Assumptions</a>,”
<em>Nature</em> <strong>452</strong>, 531 (2008)
and Samantha Stevenson and Roger Pielke, Jr.,
“<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0aef/69f0117b6f4e1d2926e1acaa6db7af963924.pdf">Assumptions of Spontaneous Decarbonization in the IPCC AR5 Baseline Scenarios</a>,”
That work drew on the
<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/emission/index.php?idp=50">Kaya identity</a>
to characterize
compared
<a href="http://www.cicero.uio.no/no/posts/klima/emissions-growth-slowdown">observed trends</a>
in the energy intensity of the world economy and the
carbon intensity of the world energy supply
to the the rates of change implied by
<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/emission/index.php?idp=0">SRES scenarios</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways">RCPs</a>,
respectively, and
conclude that the scenarios and represenative pathways were grossly
over-optimistic about the rates of decarbonization that would be achieved
spontaneously, without specific climate policies in place.</p>
<p>Here, I focus in particular, the observed historical trend was taken from
2000–2005 and 2000–2008, respectively. which may not be the best choice.
World energy and carbon intensity steadily declined from 1965–2000 and then
suddenly jumped for several years starting around 2002, which corresponded to
a period of tremendous economic growth in China.</p>

<p>China’s growth was fueled by a rapid expansion of energy consumption, and both
factories and generating plants were very inefficient, and were largely fueled
by coal. This drove both the energy intensity of China’s economy and the carbon
intenstiy of its energy supply through the roof, and this appears to have played
a large role in reversing for severl years the global trend of declining
energy and carbon intensity.
Around 2007 or so, China’s energy and carbon intensity began to fall again and
the world energy and carbon intensity fell along with it.</p>

<p>Thus, taking the observed trend from 2005–2016 seems more sensible, both
because it better matches the period in which we are calculating
the implied decarbonization trends for the first 15 years of the RCP scenarios
and also because it avoids the anomalous reversal of the historical trend
during the period of roughly 2002–2005.</p>

<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>To calculate carbon intensity and energy intensity, we need economic data
for the scenarios, so to make things simple, we use the
<a href="http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/gcamrcp">GCAM simulations of the RCPs</a>.
These are not identical to the official RCP data, but present reasonable
scenarios that produce emissions trajectories very close to the RCPs.
The GCAM versions of the pathways are calculated within a consistent
macroeconomic model of regional economies and energy use, and thus facilitate
comparisons of energy and carbon intensities.</p>
<!--
## Read GCAM Scenarios

First, we read in the GCAM scenarios from the file `GCAMRCPData.xls`:

<div id="observed-historical-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Observed Historical Data</h2>
<p>We get historical emissions data from the 2017 BP Statisical Review of World Energy
and historical economic data from the World Bank.
<!--
For convenience, we have already calculated these in the `kayadata` package, 
so we use that.
--></p>
</div>
<div id="calculate-decarbonization-rates" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculate Decarbonization Rates</h2>
<p>From the Kaya identity, the energy intensity of the economy is
given by <span class="math inline">\(e = E/G\)</span>, and the carbon intensity of the energy supply is
given by <span class="math inline">\(f = F/E\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the total primary energy consumption,
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the total carbon dioxide emissions, and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the gross world product.</p>
<p>Fractional growth rates are given by
<span class="math display">\[

<p>We implied rates under RCP and GCAM scenarios from 2005–2020 and
we calculate rates of observed (historical) change from 2005–2016.</p>

<p>Now we have the data, so we plot the implied rates of decarbonization in the
RCP and GCAM scenarios and compare them to the observed historical rates
over the same time frame.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>In contrast to the previous work, using the last 8 years of observed data on
energy and carbon intensity, the world appears to currently be headed along a
trajectory very similar to the early years of RCP 6.0 and
not too far behind the early years of RCP 4.5 (see Table <a href="#tab:rate-table">1</a> ).</p>
<p>Of course, the big cuts in the RCP 4.5 pathway occur in the future, so we should not
take this as license for complacency, but if we consider that this is comparing
the observed <em>spontaneous</em> decarbonization rate with no major climate policies
to the decarbonization rates implied by the policy-regimes of the different
RCPs, and if we also recognize that RCP 4.5 gives
<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1385">roughly 80% probability of keeping warming below 3.0°C</a>,
then this makes it much more plausible that we have time to avoid catastrophic
damage.</p>
