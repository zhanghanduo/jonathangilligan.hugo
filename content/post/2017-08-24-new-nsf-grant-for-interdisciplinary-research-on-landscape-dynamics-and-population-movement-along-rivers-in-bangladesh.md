I am co-principal investigator on a new research project, 
"[Socioecological System Dynamics Related to Livelihood, Human Migration, and 
Landscape Evolution](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1716909)" 
that just received funding from the National Science
Foundation.

This project will study interactions between natural processes and human 
activities along Bangladesh's rivers, with a focus on landscape dynamics
and population movements.

This interdisciplinary research project will examine the relationships among river and coastal processes,
landscape dynamics, and human activities and migration in a densely populated river delta. It will
enhance understanding of the scales and associations among physical and human dynamics, including
complex feedback loops among those systems. 

The project will identify how these relationships shift
over time, and it will provide new insights regarding the ways in which variable river discharge or land
modifications by humans may influence system interactions in the future. The project will yield a diverse
set of products that will have future value in both basic and applied research contexts, including data
about migration, livelihood activities, land-use, and adaptation from communities living on a shifting
coastline; detailed characterization of the role of land-water governance in shaping both contemporary
and historical social-biophysical dynamics within river deltas, and open-source computer models of
migration and landscape patterns that emerge in an environment where land is constantly created and
destroyed. 

The project will provide valuable interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for
graduate students. Other educational activities related to the research will involve students in comparable
regions of the U.S. and Bangladesh.

River deltas are complex systems facing the challenge of balancing sustainable development, resource
use, and land security in a continually shifting environment. As land and economic opportunities are
created—and sometimes destroyed—through evolving landscape dynamics, risks from floods and
conflicts over land tenure are intensified, forcing community upheaval and migration. 

The investigators
will use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates household- and community-level surveys, qualitative
interviews, collection of sedimentological and geochemical field data, time-series analyses of landscape
and institutional change, and scenario modeling. They will combine established empirical methods in the
social sciences and the earth sciences with computational modeling to study coupled dynamics of human
activity and environmental change in rural communities living along channels in a low-lying delta, where
sediment deposition and erosion create a constantly changing landscape. 

The investigators will focus on
population movement as a crucial process on the human side of these coupled dynamics. They will
characterize different types of migration as responses to environmental and socioeconomic stress and to
opportunities related to changing environmental conditions. The impacts of migration on livelihood
activities, which in turn affect the physical environment through land use, also will be assessed. With
respect to physical systems, sediment transport, and the rates of deposition and erosion will be a central
focus, because the creation or destruction of agricultural and homestead land are expected to strongly
affect migration dynamics, particularly as changing climatic regimes produce unpredictable precipitation
and flooding patterns. 

Observational data about the changing biophysical landscape and human activity
will be integrated in coupled agent-based and sediment transport models to explore the role of migration
as a potential adaptation to climatic stress and as a source of resilience in vulnerable populations.

Although the bulk of the project will focus on dynamic interactions among biophysical and human
systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta of Bangladesh, project findings will have relevance
for other densely settled deltas around the world, including the Mississippi River delta of the southern
U.S. 

This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH)
Program, grant #[1716909](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1716909).
The lead Principal Investigator is Kimberly Rogers at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, and my fellow co-principal investigators are Amanda Carrico, also at
CU, Katharine Donato at Georgetown, and Carol Wilson at LSU.
