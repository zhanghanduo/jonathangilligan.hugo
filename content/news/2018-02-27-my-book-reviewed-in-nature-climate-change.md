> Climate change---arguably one of the most pressing and politically charged issues of our time---is a problem so huge 
> and complex only governments can solve it. Such is the view that Beyond Politics: The Private Governance Response to 
> Climate Change attempts to deconstruct in our minds. By severing the seemingly inexorable tie between climate change 
> and government solutions, we can expand our conception of climate change to include private governance solutions. 
> Drawing from multiple disciplines, Michael Vandenbergh and Jonathan Gilligan, both from Vanderbilt University, USA, 
> provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the challenges of both preventing catastrophic warming and depending 
> on governmental solutions, in a time of political gridlock. In doing so, they lay the foundation for their proposal 
> that private governance currently provides the most viable solution for addressing climate change. Vandenbergh, a 
> lawyer and director of both Vanderbilt Universityâ€™s Energy, Environment, and Land Use Program and Climate Change 
> Research Network, and Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental sciences and civil and environmental 
> engineering, and associate director for research in the Climate Change Research Network, are both exceptionally 
> qualified to provide an extensively researched book with a carefully reasoned argument that offers a new realm of 
> possible climate solutions through private governance.
