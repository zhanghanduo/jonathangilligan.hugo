This course, for undergraduate and graduate students, has three major parts:
First, we cover the basic scientific
principles of how the earth's climate functions, causes of climate change
(both natural and human), and examining how these theories compare to the
evidence from direct measurements and the geological record of climate over
the past several million years.

Second, we study how climate is likely to change in the future, how this might
affect people's lives, and what can be done both to adapt to life in a changing
climate and to limit the severity of future climate change. Much of this section
uses methods from economics to assess the risks of climate change and the relative
advantages and disadvantages of different policy options.

Third, we study the politics of climate change: how does the political process
respond to the risks of climate change, what makes proposed policies more or
less likely to succeed, and what characteristics might make proposed climate policies
more likely to be adopted into practice?

A laboratory section gives students a chance to work with interactive
computer-based climate models and examine data from climate monitoring networks
and the geological record.
