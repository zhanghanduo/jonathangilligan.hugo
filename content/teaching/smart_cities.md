A _University Course_ offered under the auspices of the Vanderbilt Strategic Plan, this team-taught, project-based course will integrate technological and socio-economic approaches to challenges facing metropolitan areas experiencing unprecedented growth. It will address the infrastructure and resources needed for sustainable development and to maintain quality of life.

By applying a technology-driven, internet-of-things framework to the smart cities concept of urban development, this course will address ethical and justice concerns that include privacy and equitable access to data. Through immersive field research experiences and cross-disciplinary learning activities, students will be able to link the “biology of learning” to innovative, applied social science research experiences.

Taught jointly by faculty from Engineering, Peabody and Arts & Sciences, this course will combine lectures on the fundamental material with a semester-long, interdisciplinary group project.
