# Finisterre Theme for Hugo

This theme is adapted from the hugo-finite theme by Marcus Brinkmann,
which was inspired by consequently.org, via kieranhealy.org, and also by
the acedemic theme for Hugo.

From consequently.org and kieranhealy.org, this theme inherits the
informationally dense layout.

From the academic theme, this theme inherits some configuration
options and the social sharing buttons.

The finite theme adds the Foundation framework from Zurb.

I have added support for automatically generating publication lists similar
to those at kieranhealy.org, from bibtex files (requires python and
pandoc)

Contributions welcome!
